# FSJS Project 8: SQL Library Manager
 An app to manage the collection of books in a library

## Project Description (from Treehouse)
You have been tasked with creating an application for your local library to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data manually. The application you create should provide a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

In this project, you will build a web application that will include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. You'll be given HTML designs and an existing SQLite database. You'll be required to implement a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

This project will provide a great opportunity to start familiarizing yourself with the work of implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence, as well as leveraging helpful database related tools to view and interact with your database.

After completing this project, youâ€™ll be able to add true data persistence in your own projects, and implement, modify, interact with and maintain your own local custom SQLite database. You will also have a powerful new skill to add to your resume.
